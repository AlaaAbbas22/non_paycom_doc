This is the documentation for Automation of the different sheets regarding Bill.com to help you navigate, understand, pull information, make updates, or get started in the beginnig of each year.
The main sheet is here: [Approval Sheet of 2023/2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vwHoN5UWt_E6wVMi75IQpFi5OYvGdYd--cWBqI4lHpw/edit).
