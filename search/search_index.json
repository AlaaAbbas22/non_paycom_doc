It will be very detailed. Knowledge about JavaScript will be valuable though not necessary. This page has the code for the automation of the Payroll Log Form . The explanations are related to handling closure/opening the google form and editing the questions. For the scripts related to the Approval Sheet, go here Acessing it You can find the code in the scripts of the form. This is what you would see: Code For the first 2 lines, this is the set up for the name of the config sheet which has the dates and details about current pay period. This is a sheet in the approval spreadsheet. updateForm function: This function grabs the current pay period details (PP number, start date, end date, etc...) from the config sheet and update the form. Sample Config Sheet : restrict function: This function closes the submission form on the saturday after the submission deadline and reopens it on the saturday of the next week. Triggers These triggers are the schedule where the functions actually run. Navigate to the triggers section on the left and add triggers by the button on the right. Trigger for restrict : This function runs every week. One week it closes the form, while the other week, it reopens the form. Trigger for updateForm : This function should run every two weeks to update the form with each pay period. However, there is no biweekly triggers and there is no harm from running it every week, so just keep it similar to the restrict function.","title":"Form Scripts"},{"location":"form_scripts/#quick-get-started","text":"Update the links and sheet ids","title":"Quick get started"},{"location":"form_scripts/#introduction","text":"Here will be the details of the code being used.

Accessing the Sheets Accessing Scripts, Approval Sheet, and WS Payroll Log Form Approval Sheet of 2023/2024 This spreadsheet is the starting point. It serves as Paycom for students not on Paycom. It collects data for the students' hours, and managers also approve or remove hours from students. The script of the spreadsheet is the Google Apps Script associated with the Approval Sheet. You can find it by clicking on the Extensions tab in the spreadsheet and then selecting Apps Script . The script for the WS Payroll Log Form is in the editing page of the form. Click the three dots in the top-right corner, then select Script Editor . When functions mention they run every week, two weeks, etc., it indicates a time-based trigger set in the Google Apps Script editor. Quick Journey Summary of the Process Student Submissions By the end of the pay period, students submit the hours they worked through the WS Payroll Log Form . The responses are collected in a sheet within the Approval Sheet spreadsheet called Submissions_Source . This is not what gets processed. Another sheet called Submissions imports this data and associates a key with each entry at Column A and Column J . The key is structured as: \"[student email address] - [PP code]\", for example, \"alaa@uni.minerva.edu - PP1\". Before submission day (Thursday), an automatic reminder is sent to students to submit their hours. This reminder is managed by the contractorsSubmissionReminder function, which runs every two weeks. Managers' Approval This data is imported into the first sheet in the spreadsheet, typically named after the pay period it refers to (e.g., PP1 for submissions of PP1). After the submission day (Friday), the Google form is automatically locked using the restrict function. Managers receive an automated email on Sunday to approve or remove students' hours. This occurs in the same sheet, typically the first sheet. The function for sending manager reminders is managerApprovalReminder . Shifting Sheets Managers approve hours by changing the approval column for their interns to YES or NO. On Tuesday/Wednesday, the sheet for the previous pay period is locked, moved to the end, and a new sheet is created for the current pay period. This is handled by the copySheet function. For example, if managers approve PP1, that sheet is locked and sent to the end, then a new sheet is created for PP2. Students' Return On the following Saturday, the form for logging hours is unlocked, allowing students to submit hours for the new pay period. On Thursday, one day before the end of the pay period, a reminder is sent, and the cycle continues. Actions What to update when you arrive? Config Sheet: This sheet in the Approval Sheet is crucial. Ensure it is always up-to-date. Check the Position Tracker of the year or the Master DB for accuracy. PP Sheet: Ensure the students' names in the PP sheet (at the beginning of the spreadsheet) are correct, as they are not updated automatically. YTD Analysis: Verify that names and emails are accurate. Submissions_Source: Ensure this sheet, where hours are submitted, is connected to the correct source. It should pull the most accurate information. Triggers: Ensure the triggers on the Approval Sheet are correctly configured. These can be found in the scripts.
